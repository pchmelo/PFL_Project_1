## Shortest Path Explanation:

The `shortestPath` function is designed to find all shortest paths connecting two cities in a bidirectional, positively weighted graph representing a roadmap. This implementation is a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm, adapted to explore all possible shortest paths without the use of a priority queue due to some restrictions we faced during development.
